Perl-AI-NeuralNet-Kohonen
=========================

An illustrative implimentation of Kohonen's Self-organising Feature Maps
(SOMs) in Perl.

It's not fast - it's illustrative.

In fact, it's slow: but it is illustrative....

It could be improved to use Perl Data Language (PDL), XS or C,
but then it's be reworking code that already exists open-source.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
